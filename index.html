    <br>
   After a dreadful month, week, or day, it's important to take care of your mind and your<br>
    body in order to perform at your best. As someone who's taken a TON of mental health days, <br>
    here's my guide to a relaxing day off.

  The Night before will make or break your day off. Here's some things that'll lead you to success. <br>
 <br>
   <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Dinner</th>
        <th>Shower/Bath</th>
        <th>Sleep</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>
       
         <h5>
           Treat yourself with a meal that you've been <em>craving</em>. <br>
           Here are some of my recommendations:</h5> 
           <ol>
             <li>Eat something that's associated with a good time; e.g. if you can, hit up your childhood pizza spot.</li>
             <li>Eat something familiar. For example, anything that brings you joy within the first bite.  </li>
             <li>If you have the ingredients, make some pesto pasta(so good).</li>
             <li>And of course, stay hydrated.</li>
           </ol>
         </td>
        <td>
        Enjoy a nice steamy shower or bubble bath. The choice is yours. I reccomend lavender,coconut, or vanilla scents for tonight. Make sure to oil your skin and/or add your favorite lotions. 
        </td>
        <td>Enjoy a nice cup of warm matcha while reading your favorite book. Don't scroll on social media. It doesn't serve you. <br>
        Doze off to ambient music (432hz is my favorite) or a relazing meditation.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

  <h4 id="MorningOf">The Morning Of..</h4>
  
  <p>
    Good morning my love! Your morning is going to be light and easy. Start off by sitting in an upright position on your bed,<br>
    legs criss-cross applesause, palms facing up, and eyes closed. Focus your energy twords your breath and breathe normally. <br>
    After a few inhales and exhales, start changing it up using some of the excersises down below. Brething is my favorite way to<br>
    cope with stress, bring me back to reality, and remind me that I am human. Such a simple thing heals. <br>
    
    Next, whip up some eggs and start your omelette. 
    
    <br> 
    <br>
    I want you to journal while thats cooking and set inntentions for the day. This is important because you<br>
    don't want to slack and repeat the same cycle of stress that you've been trying to get out of.
  </p>
  
  Now that you have a plan, I'm going to be 100% honest with you. Get things done today. Please. The porodomo technique is so useful<br>
  for those who struggle with procastination.

  </h4>

  
  <p>
    Around 8 pm, you need to start settling down. Since you've already completed what needed to be done,<br>
    it's time to stay ahead of the game. <br>
    <br>
     
    <em>"Getting ready" doesn't only apply to the morning. It starts now.</em>
    
    <ul>
      <li> Prepare an outfit that makes you feel your best (<em>make sure its <br>
        comfortable)</em></li>
      <li>Meal prep. (<em>Overnight oats are quick, nutritious, and delicious. They'll<br>
        get you through the first half of the day. Make sure to pack a luscious salad with <br>
        the right dressing to match)</em></li>
      <li>Skincare!!!! This is <em> soooo </em> important. You face is the first thing people look at.<br>
      (Incorporate facial massages, steam, and ice the face for <strong>maximum</strong> effects. </li>
      <li>Read a book. (You don't want your last moment of your beautiful day to be spent on your phone.<br>
      Reading a book will spark your imagination and calm your nerves for your long day tomorrow.)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
    After you've completed all those steps, here's my advice. <strong>GO. TO. SLEEP.</strong> No matter how ready <br>
    you think you are, nothing will be worth it if you're tired and sluggish. I promise. 
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  Hopeflly by now, you're ready to send that email or call out sick. You deserve that day off and<br>
  Now you know how to tackle it!:)
